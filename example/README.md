#The folder named 'my-project' contains all of the files that compiles into an example program!
#Here is the purpose of each of the files:
## desil.toml:
- Contains all of the imported packages and all variables
- Contains all of the settings in the project:
    -  Name of project
    -  Git Repo to clone from
    -  Author
    -  And so much more!
## desil.sh
- This file is what is run before compiling.
- Some uses for this file include:
    - Installing prerequisite packages
    - Anything else that requires a setup script!
## desil.d!
- This file is the meat and potatoes! It contains all logic code!
